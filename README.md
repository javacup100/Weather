## UI part
For the UI part, I have set up the framework and finished checking the pages that appear before the homepage. It is quite a lot of work and I do not have enough time to finish all the pages.
The framework is based on cucumber+testng+java+appium. It supports script and test data split.
## API part
I used Restassured for API automation. It seems that the app uses some technology to make traffic capture more difficult. It requires extra work to capture requests on the app. So, I used the open API available on its official website.
